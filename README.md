# SequenceAnalysis
This class contains work from several labs for an intro to python for life sciences class (BME 160) at UCSC. It contains the FindOrfs class which can be used to find open reading frames in a sequence of DNA, for more detail on this look to my lab 5 repository which includes a script that can be used to implement this class with comand line functionality and some other bells and whistles. The NucParams class allows analysis of a sequences codon bias, gc content, a count of each nucleotide and a count of each codon. The proteinParams class can return from a protein sequence its molecular weight, its theoretical isoelectric point, its charge at a given PH, and its molar and mass extinction coeffecients. Taken together the class allows one with proper implementation to analyze a sequence, find all open reading frames, translate them to all possible protein sequences, and return properties of said proteins among other functionalities.
